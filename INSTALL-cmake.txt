These are the instructions for installing KD Chart using the CMake buildsystem.
CMake version 2.8.7 or higher is required.

The same source code compiles with either Qt 4 or Qt 5.

Make sure you use a C++ compiler that can handle C++11 features.

Please see the comments at the top of CMakeLists.txt for
the available configuration options you can pass to cmake.

The installation directory defaults to c:\KDAB\KDChart-<version> on Windows
and /usr/local/KDAB/KDChart-<version> on non-Windows.  You can change this
location by passing the option -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path to cmake.

1) From the top directory of your KD Chart installation create a build directory:

     mkdir build

   and change directory into that build directory:

     cd build

2) Now run 'cmake' depending on the kind of build one of the following:
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
     cmake -DKDChart_STATIC=True -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
     cmake -DKDChart_STATIC=True -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

   To define the install-location use for example:
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:/kdchart ..
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/kdchart ..

3) Unix

set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to your KD Chart installation lib directory.

If you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set already then use this line:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/kdchart/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The above has to be added into your .bashrc or similar to remain. It may also of course
be run from a shell just before building KD Chart, but in this case your settings will
only be available for this shell.

4) MacOS

Proceed as described above, but using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

5) Windows

Add the path to KD Chart lib into your LIB environment variable and the path
to KD Chart bin into your PATH environment variable.

Or run:
  set PATH=\path\to\kdchart\bin;%PATH%
  set LIB=\path\to\kdchart\lib;%LIB%

6) Build everything by typing:

make    # Unix,
nmake   # Windows

7) (optionally:) Install KD Chart:

   From your top-level KD Chart directory just type

make install   # Unix,
nmake install  # Windows

   This will copy the necessary files into the sub-directories of
   your installation path:
   For Unix/Linux, Mac: /usr/local/KDAB/KDChart-VERSION/
   For Windows that is: C:\KDAB\KDChart-VERSION\

8) Have a look at the examples applications. They will get you started with KD Chart.

== Testing ==
To build the testing harness, pass -DKDChart_TESTS=true to CMake, like so:
  % cmake -DKDChart_TESTS=true

Then run 'make test' to run the unit tests.

== Force a Qt4 build ==
On systems with both Qt4 and Qt5 available, the CMake buildsystem will always
attempt to use Qt5. To force a Qt build, pass -DKDChart_ENFORCE_QT4_BUILD=true
to CMake, as in:
  % cmake -DKDChart_ENFORCE_QT4_BUILD=true
