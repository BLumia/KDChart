These are the instructions for installing KD Chart bindings using the CMake buildsystem.

Starting with version 2.7.0 KD Chart can build Python3 bindings.

You need these:
 - Python3.6 or higher
 - Qt 5.12 or higher
 - QtForPython provided by the Qt project.

For QtForPython you install must use the exact same Qt version you are using when building KD Chart.

As this time, you cannot get shiboken2-generator because the wheels are not on PyPi.
To use the wheels do this:
  % pip3 install \
      --index-url=https://download.qt.io/official_releases/QtForPython/ \
      --trusted-host download.qt.io \
      shiboken2 pyside2 shiboken2_generator

For more info visit https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/shiboken2/gettingstarted.html

afterwards run 'pip3 list | grep PySide2'
Note the version *must* match the same Qt you intend to use when building KD Chart.

Not supported:
 - Debug builds
 - static builds
 - python2 bindings
 - only some 32-bit platforms are supported.  see https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python

Also, there are no plans to support the qmake buildsystem.

Tell CMake to build the bindings by passing the `-DKDChart_PYTHON_BINDINGS=True' option.

The bindings will be installed to the passed `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, which
might require setting the `PYTHONPATH` env variable to point to that path when
running applications.  Alternatively, configure the bindings install location by
passing (for example) `-DKDChart_BINDINGS_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages`
to CMake (adjust to the python path on your system).
