These are the instructions for installing KD Chart bindings using the CMake buildsystem.

Starting with version 3.0.0, KD Chart can build Python3 bindings.

You need these:
 - Python3.6 or higher
 - Qt 5.12 or higher
 - The PySide2 and Shiboken2 Python modules provided by the Qt project.

The PySide2 you install must use the exact same Qt version you are using when building KD Chart.
https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python/GettingStarted describes various ways to install PySide2.

We recommend using pip, for example:
% pip3 install --index-url=https://download.qt.io/snapshots/ci/pyside/5.12/latest/ pyside2 shiboken2-generator --trusted-host download.qt.io

afterwards run pip3 list | grep PySide2
make sure the version matches the same Qt you intend to use when building KD Chart

Look at https://download.qt.io/snapshots/ci/pyside for the versions available for installation

Not supported:
 - Debug builds
 - python2 bindings
 - only some 32-bit platforms are supported.  see https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python

Also, there are no plans to support the qmake buildsystem.
